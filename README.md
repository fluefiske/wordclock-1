# Wordclock
This repo contains the code for my personal Arduino Wordclock build with some wood, an ESP8266 and plenty of WS2811 addressable lights.

# Hardware

- 1 ESP8266 I've used the NodeMCU. (€8)
- 1 DS1307, RTC module with backup battery (€3)
- 114 WS2811 addressable LEDS, with solderable circuitboard. (€20 for 100) [Image](ws2811-with-circuit.jpg)
- a lot of wire.
- 1 resistor

## WIP
This is a work in progress and not done (by far). Please hold on.
